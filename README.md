# Work-On-PowerBI
A collection of Power BI dashboards engineered by me, featuring complex DAX calculations, optimized data models, and M-powered data transformations. This repo highlights my proficiency in ETL, KPI visualization, drill-through design, and interactive report building.

Power BI Portfolio – By Me

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio repository. This collection highlights my work in designing and developing interactive dashboards and insightful visual reports. With a strong foundation in data modeling, DAX, and Power Query, I transform raw datasets into impactful visual stories that drive data-informed decisions.

About This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized showcase of my Power BI skills, where I’ve applied analytical thinking and visualization techniques to create dashboards that are not just informative but intuitive and visually compelling.
Each report is crafted with:
Data transformation using Power Query (M Language)
Robust data models and defined relationships
Custom calculations using DAX
Clean, user-friendly report layouts
Interactive elements like slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks, and dynamic KPIs
